#JDI Automation UI Test Framework#

Copyright (c) 2015, EPAM Systems

##Introduction##

JDI (Just Do It) – is the test Framework for automation of UI applications testing. It extends Page Objects design pattern and introduces lot of additional elements with implementation of its common usages.
Framework used concept “Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible” Larry Wall (c). 
So all elements and abilities has default realization that mostly used, but in case your application used some actions in different way, you can override this behavior on any level (just for this element, for all elements with same type or even all elements actions scenarios usage). 
Similar you can use any kind of external tools and frameworks for related functionality (different loggers, reporting tools, drivers test runners and asserters)
We try to do test process easier and full of joy! :)
